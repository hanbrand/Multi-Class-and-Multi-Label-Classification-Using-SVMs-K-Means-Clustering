# Multi-Class-and-Multi-Label-Classification-Using-SVMs-K-Means-Clustering
This project explores **multi-class and multi-label classification** using **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and **unsupervised clustering (K-Means)** on the **Anuran Calls (MFCCs) dataset**. The dataset contains amphibian call recordings categorized into **Family, Genus, and Species**, making it a multi-label problem.
